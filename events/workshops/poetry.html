<h1>Airplane Poetry</h1>

In June, 2014, 19 poets from Bangalore got together to answer one question - is poetry dead? The result was the Airplane Poetry Movement - A project to create a vibrant and energetic spoken word poetry culture among the youth. Spoken Word, as opposed to the written form, allows you to give life to everything you write and speak. How many of you thought you needed a perfect place, the perfect breeze and perfect mood to scribble down some rhyming stuff? We think you will only need the perfect team to get you started. <br>
PS: The price at which this workshop comes is just amazing considering the repute of the APM team. Add to cart!</p>
