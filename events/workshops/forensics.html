What do Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Arrow, Gotham and Sherlock have in common? Okay, all of them

are television dramas alright. That apart there’s this one geeky nerd married to forensic science, and 

thanks to his acute observation of tiny clues and tracing of a chain of connected evidences, a herculean 

criminal case is cracked in a jiff! Ever thought that could be true, Eh? Come incident, and we bring to you 

guys from the Indian Forensic Organization (Yea, you heard it right!) who’ll treat you with Fingerprint 

analysis, Ballistics, Handwriting Analysis and investigation procedures and much more. So, why wait?</p>
