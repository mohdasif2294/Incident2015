If there’s one thing that brings together the entire country (other than Unity in Diversity like they say), it’s got to be cinema. All of us enjoy sitting in front of the screen with a bucket of Popcorn alright. But, what’s more interesting is what happens behind the screens. Who’s a director? How’s he different from a cameraman or a cinematographer? How I start writing a mind blowing script? Where does the money for production come from? <br>Find answers to these questions and much more in our Movie making workshop, here at Incident. Start. Camera. Acccttttiiiiiiiooooooonnnnn!</p>
