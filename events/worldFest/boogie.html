Mauricio (aka Boogieloop) started early at the age of 16; trying out comedy and meeting people from different cultures to enrich his experience and make his comedy accessible beyond language and culture barrier.<br>
Influenced by modern European physical clown culture and Jaques le Coq method, Mauricio has developed his signature style with a solid artistic signature. This includes mime and characters defined through animated body movements, adapted to spark the imagination, amuse the senses, and evoke emotions through poetical, visual illusions. He has performed in numerous prestigious stages worldwide - for global theater festivals among others.
