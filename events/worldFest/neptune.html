In his shows, Neptune strives to shatter traditional concepts and imagine unicycling as a performance at a whole new level. With the refined precision of balance and control as testimony to twenty years of riding experience behind him, he begins by taking the unicycle out of the circus;then,with fluidity, accuracy and skill, he presents unicycling with a whole new concept : as a primary form of art in itself.<br>
Inneptune's performance, the unicycle is the show. Rocking, flowing, spinning, hopping, fling... dancing on the unicycle in pure synchronization with the music along with tricks, stunts and freestyle. Using the unicycle as his medium he inspires awe and wonder.
