I-Care, the social event of Incident, was first organised in 2011 by an enthusiastic group of 

people who wished to inculcate humanitarian ideals among the student fraternity. Since its 

inception it has become bigger and better every year due to the commitment and dedication 

shown by an ever increasing number of altruistic volunteers.<br>

We organise two major events, one being the I-Care Day and the other, Street Plays.<br>

I-Care day is a full day event, where kids from orphanages spend a whole day in college 

engaged in various events organised. We aim on making it a fun cum learning experience by 

conducting a Sherlock Holmes event. It will be a treasure hunt based on clues which will lead 

to solving a mystery. This will take them to different parts of the campus where we will be 

explaining to them about the departments, functioning of CCC, ATM, etc. Lunch will be 

provided to them. Further into the day we have planned a T-Shirt painting workshop for them 

by the Artist Forum. The T-Shirts will be given to them at the end of the day along with 

mementos for participation.<br>

The street plays on burning topics of the country are performed to bring in awareness among

the students to make this society a better place to live. Last year, the play was about Women 

Harassment which received a wonderful response from the students as well as the media. 

This time we plan to work on Swachh Bharat, to create awareness about cleanliness. The 

street plays will be performed at the beach in the evening, during the fest.<br>

Highlight of this I-Care will be a performance by the specially-abled kids from the Lions 

Club School, Surathkal. They will be performing during Promenade, the dance competition 

of the fest.<br></p>
